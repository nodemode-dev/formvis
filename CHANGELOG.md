### Fixed before release

Found by the throttled browser verification and the Phase 2 check: Escape could not close a dialog opened with its default button disabled; double-click rename and folder disclosure did nothing; a no-op layer move created an undo entry; adding a mask, renaming a tab and the engine readout shifted layout; Inter swapped in after reveal; option bar icon buttons wrote their label into the icon box.

### Known gaps

Desktop shell not yet compiled; ML background removal not exercised end to end; Hue/Saturation and Grain adjustments render without effect; crop, retouching, gradient and shape tools, filters, Image Size, Canvas Size and `.ref` export are not built yet.

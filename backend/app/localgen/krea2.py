"""Krea 2 Turbo, an optional local image model.

formvis neither ships nor distributes Krea 2: its weights are fetched from their publishers on Hugging Face, onto
the person's own computer, when that person asks. Installing it takes one decision, recorded in
models/krea-2-consent.json before a byte is downloaded: the Krea 2 Community License Agreement accepted (its
terms shown, with the link to them). The content filter that licence requires (section 4.2),
Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection, is always installed with it and runs on every picture (content_filter.py); there
is no option to install Krea 2 without it.

A person may still remove the filter afterwards (delete its files, or change their own build of this open-source
program). Krea 2 then keeps running: the removal was theirs, knowingly made, and the Krea card and every picture
made without the filter carry REMOVED_WARNING, which the person may acknowledge (the acknowledgement is recorded
with a hash of its wording). "Reinstall the content filter" puts it back.

Whatever else happens, a prompt that sexualises minors is refused before the model runs (prompt_refusal). That is
not a setting and cannot be removed by removing the filter.

The builds: on a Mac with Apple silicon, mflux-community's MLX quantisations run through mflux (8-bit, the higher
fidelity, or 4-bit for a Mac with less memory); on Windows and Linux, the 8-bit SDNQ quantisation of a
diffusers maintainer runs through diffusers' Krea2Pipeline. Each runs in its own Python environment under the
model's folder, so its packages (MLX, or PyTorch) never enter the engine's.

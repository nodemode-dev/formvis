"""Checkpoints of a person's own: fine-tunes of Krea 2 or FLUX.2 [klein] 4B, converted to mflux's MLX format.

Dropped into the folder of the model they were made from, one folder each:

    models/checkpoints/krea-2/<name>/            (a Krea 2 fine-tune, e.g. silly_krea2)
    models/checkpoints/flux2-klein-4b/<name>/    (a Klein 4B fine-tune)

"The correct MLX format" is the folder mflux itself writes (mflux-save, or any mflux-community build): text_encoder/,
tokenizer/ and vae/, each with its files, and the transformer's weights either in transformer/ (Klein's layout) or at
the folder's top (Krea 2's), as *.safetensors. check() says what is missing; a single .safetensors file (a ComfyUI or
Automatic1111 checkpoint as Civitai serves it) is named for what it is: it has to be converted first, which the models
page describes. Each checkpoint appears in the image generator as a model of its own, runs through the same mflux as
its base model (installed with Krea 2 or Klein 4B), and takes that model's LoRAs.

A Krea 2 fine-tune is a derivative of Krea 2, so its licence applies: a Krea 2 checkpoint runs once the Krea 2
Community License Agreement has been accepted on the Krea 2 card, and the content filter runs on its pictures as on
Krea 2's (or its warning, if the filter was removed). A Klein 4B fine-tune carries its own licence, which is its
author's and the person's to honour.

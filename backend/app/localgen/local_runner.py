"""Running a local image model's process: real progress, a real cancel, and memory kept in hand.

Krea 2 and FLUX.2 [klein] run in a process of their own (mflux on Apple silicon, diffusers elsewhere). Until v2.0.7
that process was waited on in silence: the job stood at 0% until the picture appeared, a cancel only stopped the
page from asking, and two pictures asked for at once loaded two models of 10 to 22 GB side by side.

- run(): the process's output is read as it comes. Both mflux and diffusers draw their denoising progress with tqdm
  ("3/8 [00:04<00:06, ...]"), which gives the step; before the first step the job says it is loading the model, after
  the last that it is finishing the picture. A cancel ends the process (terminate, then kill) and the job is
  cancelled; a process that runs past its time limit is ended and reported with the end of its output.
- plan(): what the machine's memory allows: mflux's --low-ram (the model's parts loaded as they are needed and let go
  after) when the model would take more than about half the memory, or when the person asks for it; and a cap on
  MLX's cache (--mlx-cache-limit-gb), so the editor beside it keeps its room.
- HEAVY: one local image model runs at a time; a second picture waits for the first, and says so.

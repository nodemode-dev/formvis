name: documents-and-files
description: Opening, creating, inspecting and switching documents in formvis through its MCP tools. Use when the person wants to open a photo or project, start a new canvas at a size, see what is open, understand the layers and ids, work in several documents, undo or redo, or when a tool says no document is open or a layer id is wrong.

# documents-and-files

Tools: `get_document`, `get_image`, `new_document`, `open_file`, `switch_document`, `undo`, `redo`. Saving and exporting are in `export`.

## What each tool does

| Tool | Parameters | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_document` | none | JSON: `name`, `width`, `height`, `resolution`, `mode`, `depth`, `profile`, `activeLayerId`, `selection` (`x`, `y`, `width`, `height` or null), `documents` (`id`, `name`, `active`), `layers` bottom to top (`id`, `name`, `kind`, `visible`, `opacity`, `blend`, `parentId`) |
| `get_image` | `max_size` 64 to 2048, default 1024 | The picture as a PNG, longer side at most `max_size`, as it looks (visible layers, masks, adjustments, styles) |
| `new_document` | `width`, `height` (1 to 30000), `name`, `background` (`white`, `transparent`, `black`) | Opens a new document and makes it current |
| `open_file` | `path` (absolute) | Opens a picture or project as a new document |
| `switch_document` | `id` from `documents` | Makes that document the one tools act on |
| `undo`, `redo` | `steps` 1 to 100, default 1 | Steps through the current document's history |

Layer `kind` values: `pixels`, `text`, `shape`, `smart object`, `group`, `adjustment:[kind]` (for example `adjustment:curves`), `fill:[kind]`.

`open_file` takes PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, GIF, BMP, TIFF, HEIC and HEIF, camera raw (DNG, CR2, CR3, NEF, ARW, RAF, ORF, RW2), and the projects `.fmv`, `.psd`, `.psb` and `.ora`, up to 512 MB. Camera raw is developed with the camera's white balance. A multi-page TIFF opens its first page through this tool.

## Recipes

### Look at what is open
1. `get_document`.
2. `get_image` with `max_size` 1024 (use 2048 only to inspect detail).
3. Describe back to the person what is there before changing anything when the request is ambiguous.

### Start a canvas at a destination size
1. `new_document` with the destination's pixel size (1280 by 720 for a video thumbnail, 1080 by 1080 for a square post, 1200 by 630 for a link card), a `name`, and `background`: `white`, `black` or `transparent`.
2. `get_document` to read the new layer list and note the id.

### Work on a photo from disk
1. `open_file` with the absolute path. The new document becomes current.
2. `get_document`, `get_image`.
3. The original file is never changed; edits live in the document until `save_project` or `export_image`.

### Combine two pictures
1. `open_file` the base picture; `place_image` (see `layers-and-masks`) the second one from its path as a new layer.
2. Do not open both and try to copy between them: there is no copy-between-documents tool. `place_image` is the way.

### Several documents
1. `get_document` lists `documents`; the active one is marked.
2. `switch_document` with an `id` before any tool that should act on another document. After `upscale`, the new upscaled document is already current.

### Take back a mistake
1. `undo` (default one step). Every tool call is one step; a multi-step recipe needs as many `undo` steps as tools you called.
2. `get_image` to confirm. `redo` steps forward again.

## When it fails

- "No document is open": `new_document` or `open_file`.
- "No layer has the id": the id came from before an `undo`, a merge or a delete; call `get_document` again.
- `open_file` errors name the problem (not absolute, not found, extension not taken, over 512 MB); give an absolute path to a file that exists.
- A picture beyond formvis's limits (30,000 pixels a side, and a pixel budget of about 100 megapixels unless raised in Preferences) may be refused; read the message and, if needed, tell the person it has to be opened by hand in the window, where formvis offers to open large pictures in pieces.
